The software includes an attractive visual interface that allows users to not only collect and arrange online objects, but to shape these collections into compelling narratives.

By combining Storyscope with Europeana's API, users are able to search Europeana directly through Storyscope, and add other digital objects to enhance Europeana's vast collections. During the Hack4Europe Ireland event, the team built a narrative around the activities of Irish citizens at the Western Front. Through this sample story, they were able to draw connections between people from different cultural backgrounds through the lens of WWI experiences, revealing a 'common ground' that once proved so divisive in European history.
