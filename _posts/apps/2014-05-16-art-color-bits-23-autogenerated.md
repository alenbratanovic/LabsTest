Art Color Bits introduces an innovative way of browsing painters' works by colours.

The software gets all the paintings of an author available in the Europeana database and extracts the main colors from each artwork. After that, the whole collection is arranged chronologically with special attention to the main colors. In this way, the app visualises the painter's evolution in the use of colors through the different periods of his/her life. This prototype is focused on Picasso's works. Winner in the category 'Most innovative app' (shared with Visual Chronology)
