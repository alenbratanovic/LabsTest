Fancy Search is a Europeana Search API component prototype for Joomla 1.6.

 It complements the Joomla CMS component developed by the same team at the Hilversum hackathon with a Who?What?When?Where? search, mashed up with Freebase and Geonames, interactive maps, a timeline and a visual display of results on a slideshow. Related searches can be performed on any Europeana metadata values. The code is Open Source and ready to be used immediately.
