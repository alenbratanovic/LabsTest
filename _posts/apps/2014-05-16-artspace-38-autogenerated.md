ArtSpace promotes access to art in everyday situations i.e. Europeana collections can be made available in public places such as coffee shops, libraries, schools and hotels.

Making use of LCD displays and an online Collection Management System allows us to provide a "Virtual art leasing" service and highly personalised curation. Winner in the category 'Most innovative app' at Hack4Europe '11 - Poland. Finalist at the Digital Agenda Assembly, June 2012, Brussels.
