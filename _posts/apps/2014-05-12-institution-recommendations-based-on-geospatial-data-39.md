Winner in the category 'Greatest Commercial Potential' and the category 'Developers' Pick' (together with 'Art Seeker') at Hack4Europe '11 - Poland. The prototype is a mobile web application which recommends Europeana content providers near to a user's location (based on his/her current GPS coordinates) and shows their content on Europeana. 

The application tries to fill the gap between the collections and the end-users by providing additional social features like a check-in and achievement system (the user gets points for content review, recommendation, enrichment) and interaction with other users.
