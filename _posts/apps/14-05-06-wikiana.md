The Wikiana prototype combines Wikipedia with the data available in Europeana.

The user can copy the URL of their favourite (or any other) Wikipedia page and it will automatically be augmented with images taken from Europeana that match the page content. This allows the user to discover the data in Europeana using an interface and a context that they are likely to be more familiar with.
