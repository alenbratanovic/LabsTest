euKindleSearch easily produces e-books for the Amazon Kindle based on searches in the Europeana collections. Winner in the category 'Greatest Commercial Potential'

The prototype's first version allows users to search for item records from UK collections. Search results are shown in the Kindle Browser. Links display items in a separate page with a complete description. Further links lead to the data supplier. It is also possible to download search results as an e-book (mobipocket) either to PC or direct to Kindle.
