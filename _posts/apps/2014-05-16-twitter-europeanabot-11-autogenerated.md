Inspired by the DPLABot, this implementation uses Europeana API to present semi-random images from Europeana collections on Twitter.

The program takes a list of "seed terms" from a file, searches for corresponding images on Europeana and posts the URL of the first result to the Twitter-Account EuropeanaBot. The current implementation has used Austrian place names and a list of Nobel Prize winners.
