This interface allows simultaneous search of many of the Library's catalogued collections, including digitised material.

A new feature is that results from Europeana are also returned for every search, using a sidebar widget. The widget shows six items from Europeana with an option to see the full search result on the Europeana portal. Results from the National Library's contributions to Europeana are filtered out to remove duplicates.
