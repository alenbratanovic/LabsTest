TimeMash is a search client for historical data from Europeana. 

It allows users to search both in map and list form, to filter theirs search and to look for interesting objects in the immediate vicinity (guided by the user's GPS). It simplifies the process of seeking out and connecting to history when on location. Through the app, you can also capture a new image to complement the old. The camera puts the old, original, as a thin overlay in the viewfinder and you can easily fade in and out to ensure that you get as similar picture as possible. The result can then be shared with the world by uploading it to the TimeMash server. While uploading the new picture, you can also contribute and refine your geo-location, refining it, so that more people can find the same location, admire it and contribute their own images.
