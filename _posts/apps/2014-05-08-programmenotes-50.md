The team built a simple HTML5 player displaying interactive historical information related to a musical work while the track plays through SoundCloud.

Score excerpts, composer pictures, location maps, and other context will appear as clickable items above the track player, courtesy of APIs from Popcorn.js, SoundCloud, MuseScore, Wikipedia, Twitter, Google Maps and Europeana, with content from the British Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France, IMSLP and other Europeana data providers.
