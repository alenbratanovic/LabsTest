Winner in the category ‘Digital Humanities‘ at Hack4LT. Crowdhwr is a crowdsourcing manuscripts' transcription system for digital humanities.

The prototype allows to mark words in a digitized manuscript taken from Europeana and prepare it for analysis. It provides a tool to convert image to text in order to perform automatic search of a manuscript's content. The system was developed by using Python and JavaScript languages, SciPy and NumPy packages, and Django framework.
