Winner in the category 'Greatest commercial potential' at Hack4Europe '12 - Belgium. Finalist at the Digital Agenda Assembly, June 2012, Brussels.

Stackathon is a mobile application that allows users to select works (e.g. art works or artefacts) in Europeana, give them audio annotations and then share the selected works and annotations with the world. In this way users can curate and critique their own collections of art.
