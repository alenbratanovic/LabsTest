The prototype allows the user to view Europeana geo-enabled items in an augmented reality mode on Layar compatible devices.

Layar is the world leading augmented reality browser. Europeana Layar has adapted the Europeana XML feed to be able to work with PorPOISe, the Open Source Layar server. In its first version, the prototype geo-references all Picasso's work currently available in the Europeana database in Spain. Users can view image miniatures for every item in augmented reality mode on their devices, and can also access every item page on Europeana. Winner in the category 'Greatest commercial potential'.
