History4u is a mobile application for Windows 7 which allows the search and display of historical photographs available on Europeana.The application uses GPS technology to identify the nearest place based on the user's current coordinates and presents old pictures of this location.

Tapping on a picture will open a screen with the picture details. Alternatively, the user can find a specific place by searching for a location name (text search) or browsing and selecting a place on an interactive map. Subject for further development are interactive features, such as sharing the found photographs on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare), introducing a rating system (find the best picture per location), creating browsable histories of these historical photographs, etc. Winner in the category 'Social Inclusion'.
