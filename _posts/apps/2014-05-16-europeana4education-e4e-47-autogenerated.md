E4E is a set of two widgets that automatically suggest cultural resources from Europeana and learning resources from Open Discovery Space. It is aimed at authors of educational pathways. E4E widgets can be integrated into an authoring environment such as OMEKA to augment the authoring process and to enhance the educational impact of a pathway. The main rationale behind E4E development was to explore the educational uses of items on Europeana. The E4E widgets were developed in the context of the Natural Europe and Open Discovery Space projects. Winner in the category 'Social Inclusion' at Hack4Europe '12 - Belgium.
