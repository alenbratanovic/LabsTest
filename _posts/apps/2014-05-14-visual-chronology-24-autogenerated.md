Visual Chronology is a sketch displaying Europeana search results on a timeline. At the bottom of the screen, years are represented by dots.

The larger the dot, the more results were found for that year. This info graphic doubles as navigation for jumping or scrolling through time. The tool could be applied in an exhibition context, for example with a touchscreen interface. Winner in the category 'Most innovative app' (shared with Art Color Bites).
