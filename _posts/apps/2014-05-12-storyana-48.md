Winner in the category 'Most innovative app.' at Hack4Europe '12 - Belgium. Storyana is a novel interface for exploring Europeana's vast and interesting collections through short stories.

 In order to automatically create these stories, Storyana accesses the Wikipedia article for the topic the user is interested in, splits it into pages, and then finds items in Europeana to illustrate the pages. All the user has to do is type in the topic they are interested in or copy-and-paste a Wikipedia URL. The system fetches the Wikipedia article and uses natural-language-processing techniques to extract the content and create the story. For each page, the most important keywords are determined, sent to Europeana's open-search API and four items that match the content on the page are selected. This is a development of the Wikiana app created at the Vienna hackathon in October 2011.
