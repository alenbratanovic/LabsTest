Over 6000 books have been digitised via EOD. Through the Europeana API, EOD search results are enriched with relevant Europeana records.

The eBooks on Demand (EOD) search makes currently available over 3,4 Mio records from 24 libraries by giving direct access to the items already digitised on users' requests and through other projects as well as books offered for digitisation on demand. 

EOD was a partner in the EuropeanaConnect project and has contributed 1000 items to the Europeana portal so far. Over 6000 books have been digitised via EOD. 

Through the Europeana API, EOD search results are enriched with relevant Europeana records. Thus, any user can easily check if an item has possibly already been digitised and uploaded to the Europeana portal by EOD or one of the numerous European projects.
