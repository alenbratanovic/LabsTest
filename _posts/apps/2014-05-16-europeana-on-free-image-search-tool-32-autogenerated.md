The prototype is a further development of the Free Image Search Tool (FIST), a tool to help illustrate articles on Wikipedia.

FIST can be used to find images by searching in article categories or lists of articles. It compares the name of the article (all articles in the category/categories/list, articles with no images, or with less than x images) with free pictures in e.g. Wikimedia Commons or Flickr, and then links the findings to a simple upload tool. In this way, users will be able to illustrate a whole article category with one search, instead of having to search individually for each article. The prototype allows images from Europeana collections to be used in Wikipedia articles.
