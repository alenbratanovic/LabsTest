This prototype has been inspired by the addictive Facebook game Farmville.

 It is a curation app and game which allows users to build, share and compare their own museums created by selecting content from Europeana. The demo has attractive graphic design and a user interface adapted for touch screens, especially tablets (works on both iPad and Android tablets).
