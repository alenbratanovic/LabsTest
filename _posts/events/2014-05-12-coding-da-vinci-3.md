The hackathon is organised by the German Digital Library, Digital Service Center Berlin, Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and Wikimedia Germany. It brings together developers, web and game designers and representatives of cultural institutions to explore ideas for re-use of cultural content. 

The event begins with a presentation of various content resources and APIs (incl. Europeanaâ€™s) and continues with a data expert workshop, best practice projects presentations and coding sessions. 

The hackathon sets the start of a ten weeks (offline) sprint for further prototype development.
