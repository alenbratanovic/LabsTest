Apps for Europe provides tools to transform ideas for data based applications and services into viable businesses. It brings together a network of individuals and organisations from across Europe who are involved in promoting open data competitions.

The International Business Lounge is the culmination of the first year of Apps for Europe. From the various Business Lounge events that have taken place and an open call for participants, ten winners have been chosen to present their work at FutureEverything.

Frank Kresin, Chair of the judging panel for the International Business Lounge, will introduce the vision of the Apps For Europe programme and the ten finalists who will be presenting their work.
