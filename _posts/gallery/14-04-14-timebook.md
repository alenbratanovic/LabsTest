Timebook is an aggregator of information coming from DBPedia, Wikiquote and Europeana about personalities of the past (in particular composers, painters, writers or artists in general). It formats the information in the form of a Facebook-like profile, creating a social network of artists by looking at the influences in each other's works.

Applications of the system could be found in education, promotion and exploration of digital libraries. Winner in the category 'Social Inclusion' and winner of the 'Audience award'

Finalist at the Digital Agenda Assembly, June 2011, Brussels
