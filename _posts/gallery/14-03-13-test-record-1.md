This API complements search results within the digital library of the Larramendi Foundation with results from Europeana.

The Larramendi Foundation maintains a digital library with works of literature and historical documentation on cathedrals. One of their strengths is their rich collection of works of and on Aristotle. As a Europeana data provider, they have chosen to use our API to complement search results in their own search services with results from Europeana.
